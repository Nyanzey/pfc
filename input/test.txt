The hospice smells like antiseptic and failed dreams. A Christmas-themed air freshener dangles from the IV stand, swaying in time with my father’s mechanical wheezing. It smells like cinnamon. And regret. The fluorescent lights hum, drowning out the morphine’s slow drip.

Hi, I’m the man who never amounted to anything. The trophy-less disappointment. If life is a race, I’m the guy who tripped in the first ten feet and never got back up. Thirty-five years old, still renting, and my most significant contribution to society is a viral video of me accidentally setting fire to a microwave burrito. That’s me. Proud owner of a pile of unwashed dishes and a credit score so low it could run for public office.

I sit slouched in the corner, watching my dad suck on life like it’s a particularly stubborn milkshake. He’s enormous—round face, round belly, round everything. A human snowman melted into a hospice bed. The kind of guy who built his whole life on being likable. For thirty years, he played Santa Claus at the mall. Not just any Santa, mind you. He was the Santa. The one people drove four counties over to see. His face still pops up on Christmas cards across the Midwest. A local legend. A walking, jolly Norman Rockwell painting.

And me? I’m the guy who gave him a $10 fornite card for Christmas. You’d think that’s why he’s dying, the look he gave me when he opened it.

He beckons me closer, his hand shaking like a rusty wind-up toy. “Come here, kiddo.”

“Yeah, sure,” I say, dragging the chair closer. It screeches against the linoleum, like it’s legs are fighting with the floor. “What is it this time? Another story about how you single-handedly saved Christmas at the mall in ’93?”

His laugh comes out like a wheeze caught in a blender. Then he stops, face turning deadly serious, eyes boring into mine. “I’ve got a confession, kiddo. Something big.”
