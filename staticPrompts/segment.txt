# Tasks:

- Segment the Narrative:

Partition the narrative into fragments, ensuring each fragment represents a distinct scene or meaningful unit of the story. Only create a new fragment when there is a significant change in the scene (location, time) or characters (appearance, actions).

- Text-to-Image Prompt Generation:

Create a detailed text-to-image prompt for each fragment. Use specific character names and vivid details to capture the essence of the scene.

- Detect Changes:

Identify whether a change occurs in:

Scene: A shift in location, time, or atmosphere.
Appearance: A noticeable change in the physical appearance or clothing of a character.

- Update Context:

Continuously update and provide the current context of the story based on events described in the fragments.

# Considerations:

- Current Context: The narrative context provided should guide the interpretation of the story. Use it to maintain continuity.

- Original Content: Do not modify the original story content in the fragments.

- Specificity: Avoid generic references like "a man" or "a woman"; use the provided character names.

# Output format

[<first fragment>][<change in appearance>-<change in scene>](<text to image prompt>)[<second fragment>][<change in appearance>-<change in scene>](<text to image prompt>)[Context](<updated context>)
