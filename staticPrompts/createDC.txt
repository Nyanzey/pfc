Task: Given the following story labeled as "Narrative," complete these tasks:

# Character Description:

-Identify and describe the physical appearance of each character the moment they first appear in the story.
-Include details such as body build, hair color/style, clothing, and any notable accessories (e.g., hats, jewelry).

# Scene Description:

-Describe the visual characteristics of the first scene in the story, including surroundings, objects, weather, lighting, and overall atmosphere.
-Do not include references to characters in the description of the scene

# Considerations:

-Be as detailed as possible, especially when describing colors, textures, and other visual features.
-Focus on specificity to help a text-to-image model generate characters and scenes accurately.
-Include only the initial appearance of characters. Ignore any changes that occur later in the story.
-For scenes or characters lacking explicit details, infer details from the context and describe them creatively.

# Output Format: For each character and scene, use the following format:

[<character name>](<detailed description of character appearance>)[<character name>](<detailed description of character appearance>)
...[scene](<detailed description of first scene>)

Example:

Narrative: Once upon a time, there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother. The grandmother had given her a little red velvet cap, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. She was known as Little Red Riding Hood.

Response:

[Little Red Riding Hood](A small girl with a slim build, wearing a bright red velvet hooded cape. Her hair is chestnut brown, tied in loose braids falling past her shoulders. She is wearing a simple white cotton dress beneath the cape, with a pair of black leather shoes. Her pale skin and bright, curious eyes give her a lively appearance.)[Grandmother](A frail, elderly woman with silver hair tied up in a bun. She is wearing a long brown woolen dress and a white apron. Her face is wrinkled but kind, with a gentle smile. Her eyes are soft, framed by round spectacles resting on her nose.)[scene](The scene opens in a small, cozy cottage surrounded by a lush green forest. The sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. A path leads from the cottage's wooden door into the forest, and the smell of fresh pine fills the air. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves.)
