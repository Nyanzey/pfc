    "descriptions": "Little Red Riding Hood:\"A young girl with a delicate, petite frame, donning a little cap of red velvet, which she received from her grandmother and suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. She has long, chestnut-brown hair that cascades down her back in loose waves, peeking out from under her cap. She wears a simple, white cotton dress complemented by sturdy black leather shoes. Her skin is fair, and her eyes are wide with innocence and wonder. Having been running about picking flowers, she now carries a bouquet along with a piece of cake and a bottle of wine to take to her grandmother.\"\nMother of Little Red Riding Hood:\"A woman of average build with gentle features. Her hair is a deep shade of auburn, styled simply and tied back into a low bun. She wears a modest, faded blue dress, covered with a clean, practical white apron. Her demeanor is caring and slightly worn, reflective of her nurturing duties.\"\nWolf:\"The wolf is now wearing the grandmother's modest clothing, including her simple white cap and faded, floral-patterned nightgown. Though these garments are oversized and odd-fitting on his large, imposing frame, he remains disguised in the grandmother\u2019s attire while lying in her bed.\"\nGrandmother:\"A frail woman with a slight stature, suggesting her advanced age. She has silver hair, thin and wispy, typically hidden beneath a simple white cap. Her clothing is modest, consisting of a faded, floral-patterned nightgown that drapes loosely over her form. Her skin is pale and slightly translucent, with deep-set wrinkles marking her visage.\"\nScene:\"The scene now includes the interior of the grandmother's house. It is a small, cozy room with a single bed, where the wolf lies dressed in the grandmother's clothes. The curtains are drawn, creating a dim, shadowy atmosphere. The transition from the serene woods to this enclosed, slightly ominous space marks a shift in the setting from peaceful to foreboding, as the wolf's deception unfolds in this intimate setting.\"\nScene:\"\"",
    "segment": "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\n\nShe called out, \"Good morning,\" but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.",
