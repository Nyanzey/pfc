    "descriptions": "Little Red Riding Hood:\"A young girl with a delicate, petite frame, donning a little cap of red velvet, which she received from her grandmother and suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. She has long, chestnut-brown hair that cascades down her back in loose waves, peeking out from under her cap. She wears a simple, white cotton dress complemented by sturdy black leather shoes. Her skin is fair, and her eyes are wide with innocence and wonder. She is carrying a piece of cake and a bottle of wine to take to her grandmother.\"\nMother of Little Red Riding Hood:\"A woman of average build with gentle features. Her hair is a deep shade of auburn, styled simply and tied back into a low bun. She wears a modest, faded blue dress, covered with a clean, practical white apron. Her demeanor is caring and slightly worn, reflective of her nurturing duties.\"\nWolf:\"A large, imposing creature with a sleek coat of dark gray fur, accentuated by lighter, almost silver streaks. His eyes are sharp and cunning, with a predatory glint. Despite his menacing air, he moves with an air of deceptive friendliness. His ears are pointed, and his snout is long, ending in a sharp black nose.\"\nGrandmother:\"A frail woman with a slight stature, suggesting her advanced age. She has silver hair, thin and wispy, typically hidden beneath a simple white cap. Her clothing is modest, consisting of a faded, floral-patterned nightgown that drapes loosely over her form. Her skin is pale and slightly translucent, with deep-set wrinkles marking her visage.\"\nScene:\"The scene is set at the edge of a dense wood, as Little Red Riding Hood makes her way through the trees. The path is surrounded by lush greenery and tall, towering oak and nut trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The atmosphere is serene yet slightly foreboding, with the rustling of leaves and distant bird calls echoing through the forest. It is early in the day, with soft sunlight filtering through the canopy, adding a warm glow to the surroundings. This is where Little Red Riding Hood encounters the wolf on her way to her grandmother's house.\"",
    "segment": "The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n\n\"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood,\" said he.\n\n\"Thank you kindly, wolf.\"\n\n\"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\n\n\"To my grandmother's.\"\n\n\"What have you got in your apron?\"\n\n\"Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\"\n\n\"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\n\n\"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it,\" replied Little Red Riding Hood.",
