    "descriptions": "Little Red Riding Hood:\"A young girl with a delicate, petite frame, donning a little cap of red velvet, which she received from her grandmother and suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. She has long, chestnut-brown hair that cascades down her back in loose waves, peeking out from under her cap. She wears a simple, white cotton dress complemented by sturdy black leather shoes. Her skin is fair, and her eyes are wide with innocence and wonder. She is carrying a piece of cake and a bottle of wine to take to her grandmother.\"\nMother of Little Red Riding Hood:\"A woman of average build with gentle features. Her hair is a deep shade of auburn, styled simply and tied back into a low bun. She wears a modest, faded blue dress, covered with a clean, practical white apron. Her demeanor is caring and slightly worn, reflective of her nurturing duties.\"\nWolf:\"A large, imposing creature with a sleek coat of dark gray fur, accentuated by lighter, almost silver streaks. His eyes are sharp and cunning, with a predatory glint. Despite his menacing air, he moves with an air of deceptive friendliness. His ears are pointed, and his snout is long, ending in a sharp black nose.\"\nGrandmother:\"A frail woman with a slight stature, suggesting her advanced age. She has silver hair, thin and wispy, typically hidden beneath a simple white cap. Her clothing is modest, consisting of a faded, floral-patterned nightgown that drapes loosely over her form. Her skin is pale and slightly translucent, with deep-set wrinkles marking her visage.\"\nScene:\"\"",
    "segment": "One day her mother said to her, \"Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it.\"\n\nI will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.",
