    "descriptions": "Hansel:\"A small boy with a lean build, likely due to scarcity of food. He has short, unkempt brown hair and bright, inquisitive eyes. Hansel wears a simple, worn-out coat that has been patched multiple times, indicative of his family's poverty. Stuffed in his coat pocket are pebbles that he uses to leave a trail. His attire is completed with rudimentary shoes, too big for his feet, suggesting they are hand-me-downs.\"\nGretel:\"A little girl with a tender appearance, similar in build to her brother, suggesting signs of malnourishment. She has long, tangled, light-brown hair, which she occasionally tries to tame with her hands. Her clothing consists of a faded dress that's slightly too big for her frame, secured with a fraying apron around her waist where she hides her bread. Her eyes are large and expressive, often showing her sensitivity and worry.\"\nFather:\"An emaciated man with weary eyes and a gentle demeanor, displaying the toll poverty has taken on him. His hair is thinning and peppered with gray, conveying a sense of age beyond his years. He wears a tattered tunic and trousers, each piece showing multiple repairs. His expression is one of sadness and conflict, helpless in the face of his family's predicament.\"\nStepmother:\"A stern-looking woman with sharp features and thin lips, often set in a dissatisfied frown. Her hair, pulled back tightly into an austere bun, reveals streaks of gray, contrasting against her otherwise dark hair. She wears a simple dress of drab color, devoid of adornment, resonating with her practical and harsh nature. Her posture is stiff and uncompromising, reflecting a personality hardened by struggle.\"\nScene:\"The opening scene is set in a small, impoverished cottage nestled at the edge of a vast, imposing forest. The cottage is a quaint structure made of rough-hewn wood, its thatched roof showing signs of age and neglect, with moss growing in patches. Surrounding the cottage is a garden overrun by weeds, hinting at better times now absent. The atmosphere is somber, with a pervasive sense of struggle heightened by the land's barrenness. The moon casts a cold, silvery luminescence on the scene, causing small white pebbles on the ground to glint like coins. The night is quiet and still, with only the distant rustle of leaves in the wind breaking the silence, capturing the desolation and isolation the family experiences as they try to survive amidst great dearth.\"",
    "segment": "Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once, when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.",
