    "descriptions": "Little Red Riding Hood:\"A young girl with a delicate, petite frame, donning a little cap of red velvet, which she received from her grandmother and suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. She has long, chestnut-brown hair that cascades down her back in loose waves, peeking out from under her cap. She wears a simple, white cotton dress complemented by sturdy black leather shoes. Her skin is fair, and her eyes are wide with innocence and wonder.\"\nMother of Little Red Riding Hood:\"A woman of average build with gentle features. Her hair is a deep shade of auburn, styled simply and tied back into a low bun. She wears a modest, faded blue dress, covered with a clean, practical white apron. Her demeanor is caring and slightly worn, reflective of her nurturing duties.\"\nWolf:\"A large, imposing creature with a sleek coat of dark gray fur, accentuated by lighter, almost silver streaks. His eyes are sharp and cunning, with a predatory glint. Despite his menacing air, he moves with an air of deceptive friendliness. His ears are pointed, and his snout is long, ending in a sharp black nose.\"\nGrandmother:\"A frail woman with a slight stature, suggesting her advanced age. She has silver hair, thin and wispy, typically hidden beneath a simple white cap. Her clothing is modest, consisting of a faded, floral-patterned nightgown that drapes loosely over her form. Her skin is pale and slightly translucent, with deep-set wrinkles marking her visage.\"\nScene:\"\"",
    "segment": "Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.",
