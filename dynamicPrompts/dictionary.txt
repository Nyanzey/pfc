[Little Red Riding Hood](A petite young girl with a fair complexion.She has shoulder-length, wavy brown hair that peeks out from beneath a bright red velvet cap, which is tied under her chin with a ribbon. She wears a knee-length, simple dress made of soft linen in a pale blue shade, with a white apron tied around her waist. Her shoes are black, flat, and made for walking through the woods. She carries a small woven basket covered with a checkered red-and-white cloth.)

[Mother](A woman of medium build, with straight dark brown hair tied back into a simple bun. She wears a plain but neat cotton dress in earthy green tones, with an apron over it. Her clothes show signs of daily work, with smudges of flour from baking.)

[Grandmother](An elderly woman, frail and thin, with wisps of gray hair peeking out from under a white bonnet. She wears a long, loose nightgown with faded floral patterns, and her face is lined with age. She is bedridden, covered by a woolen blanket, and her movements are slow and weak.)

[Wolf](A large, imposing wolf with sleek, dark gray fur and sharp yellow eyes. He has a cunning expression, and his movements are smooth and predatory. His body is lean and muscular, with a long bushy tail and sharp claws, and his ears are perked up, always alert.)

[Huntsman](A tall, broad-shouldered man with short, curly brown hair. He has a rugged appearance, with a light stubble on his face, wearing a green hunting jacket with leather patches on the elbows, sturdy brown trousers, and high boots. A leather belt holds his hunting knife and an axe, and he carries a rifle slung over his shoulder. His expression is serious and determined.)

[Scene](A cozy, rustic kitchen with a wooden floor and simple handmade furniture. A wooden table holds a woven basket of bread, and an old brick fireplace with a black iron kettle hangs over a small fire. Sunlight streams in through a small window with flower patterned curtains, casting warm light on the stone walls. The kitchen smells of freshly baked bread and herbs, creating a homely atmosphere.)
