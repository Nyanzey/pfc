Lena stood alone at the bus stop, the early morning fog curling around her coat. 
She stepped onto the bus and sat by the window, watching the sleepy town roll past. 
At school, she handed her essay to the teacher with a shy smile and trembling fingers. 
By lunchtime, a note slipped into her locker read, "You're braver than you think." 
That evening, she wrote a new storyâ€”this time, about a girl who didn't give up.
